# 8-week-sql-challenge
After reviewing my SQL skills, I decided to use the [8-week SQL challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) by Danny Ma to put my skills to the test. All the SQL code I used to finish the weekly tasks will be posted here, and there will be a PPT following posted on LinkedIn. If you are interested in more explanations on the SQL, more insights, or want to leave feedback and discuss with me. Feel free to find me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aubree-man-ying-cheng-6b00b6158/)!

# 8-week-sql-challenge
After reviewing my SQL skills, I decided to use the 8-week SQL challenge to put my skills to the test. All the SQL code I used to finish the weekly tasks will be posted here, and there will be a PPT following posted on LinkedIn. If you are interested in more explanations on the SQL, more insights, or want to leave feedback and discuss with me. Feel free to find me through LinkedIn!

## Exercise in Progress
Week 3 - Foodie-Fi

## Tools used
Week 1 on Danny's Diner and Week 2 on Pizza Runner are done with Snowflake. While the other weeks will probably be on BigQuery. There may be some syntax and function differences throughout the files.
